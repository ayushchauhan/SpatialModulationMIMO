# SpatialModulationMIMO

This repository contains MATLAB code of the B.Tech. Thesis Project (BTP) on 'Optimal Trade-off between Spectral and Energy Efficiency in Spatial Modulation-MIMO Systems' carried out under the guidance of Prof. Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi, ECE Dept., IIT Roorkee. The source code as well as the results are divided into two parts - 1. for preparing the BTP thesis, 2. for paper submission. The final thesis is included here for reference whereas the paper can be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8891293.
